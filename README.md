#html-init

Install as a command line tool with `npm install -g html-init`. To create a basic HTML file that looks like this in the directory you're in, run `html-init path/to/file.html`.

The HTML file contains the following:

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
  </html>

```

For example, `html-init index.html` will create a new HTML file index.html.
